Hello and welcome to my project OPX.

This is a little guide getting introduced
in the development of OPX (at the moment
it is in a quite early stage).

If you want to compile this the first time,
then you should have installed the library SDL
and a suitable environment for OpenCL
(i.e. AMD-APP-SDK),OpenGL, gcc and make.
For Ubuntu these are the additional packages:
build-essential
libsdl1.2-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev

After this is checked you can use the makefile.
First type: "make first"
Followed by: "make main" twice
But later compiling just needs a simple "make main"
and at last you can use the programm by starting
the "main" file.
