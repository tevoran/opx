Welcome to my project OPX.

If you want to compile this the first time,
then you should have installed the library SDL
and a suitable environment for gcc and make.

After this is checked you can use the makefile.
First type: "make first"
Followed by: "make main" twice
At least you can use the programm by starting
the "main" file.

I will try in the future to improve my project
for the use by others.
